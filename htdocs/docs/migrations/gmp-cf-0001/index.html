      <h1>Overview</h1>

<p>We recently discovered an issue affecting versions 1.1.0, 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 of
the Genesis Cloud Foundry Kit. Locket and Diego were incorrectly configured to
place their tables in the <code>postgres</code> database, instead of their dedicated
<code>locketdb</code> and <code>diegodb</code> databases.</p>

<p>While this does not affect day-to-day operation of Cloud Foundry, we
still see this an issue that needs to be corrected as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Please note that although your PostgreSQL instance may already contain
<code>locketdb</code> and <code>diegodb</code> databases, they are empty and unused. All tables
that should be in those databases were instead created in the <code>postgres</code>
database.</p>

<h1>Analysis</h1>

<p>A major rewrite of internal Genesis YAML occurred for the 1.1.0 kit release, as
various components were upgraded and required configuration changes. Namely,
one of these changes was to the database connection information.</p>

<p>For <code>diego</code> and <code>locket</code>, their BOSH release configuration uses the term
<code>db_schema</code> to refer to the name of the desired database, and <code>db_driver</code> to
set the type of database used (typically <code>mysql</code> or <code>postgres</code>)</p>

<pre><code>sql.db_schema:
    description: "Database name to use for connecting to SQL backend"
    default: ""
sql.db_driver:
    description: "Database driver to use for SQL backend (for example: mysql,postgres)"
    default: mysql
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas for most other SQL configuration YAML blocks used a variation of
<code>db_name</code> or <code>database.name</code> to refer to the desired database name, and
<code>db_type</code> or <code>database.type</code> to refer to the type of database used.</p>

<pre><code>database.name:
    description: "Name of logical database to use."
database.type:
    description: "Type of database: postgres or mysql"
</code></pre>

<p>Mistakenly, we set <code>sql.db_schema</code> to an internal <code>db_scheme</code> variable that
Genesis sets according to operator configuration. Depending on environment
settings, <code>sql.db_schema</code> was either set to <code>postgres</code> or <code>mysql</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sql:
    db_host:      (( grab params.locketdb_host ))
    db_port:      (( grab params.locketdb_port ))
    db_schema:    (( grab params.locketdb_scheme ))
    db_username:  (( grab params.locketdb_user ))
    db_password:  (( grab params.locketdb_password ))
    db_driver:    (( grab params.locketdb_scheme ))
</code></pre>

<p>Because PostgreSQL has a database named <code>postgres</code>, and MySQL has a database
named <code>mysql</code> by default, our mistake went unnoticed because Cloud Foundry
still operated normally as it was able to access and write to those databases.</p>

<p>To fix this, we are making changes to <code>db_schema</code> to reference the proper
<code>db_name</code> variable set. To mitigate future occurrences of internal YAML variable
misuse, we plan to organize the Cloud Foundry kit's <code>params</code> variables
into <code>meta</code> and <code>params</code>, a paradigm that we've used successfully for newer
kits.</p>

<h1>Impact</h1>

<p>We believe the impact to be minimal to the stability and runtime of your Cloud
Foundry deployments. However, it is in the best interest to correct this
problem as confusion stemming from unorganized data may arise. Specifically,
it's possible that selective backups of Cloud Foundry databases expected Diego
and Locket data to be in their proper database names; however backups taken of
<code>diegodb</code> and <code>locketdb</code> are empty.</p>

<p>The fix for this issue will require downtime. In our testing, applications
were inaccessible for 15 minutes while the fix was being applied.</p>

<h1>The Process</h1>

<p>The following sections contain step-by-step instructions on how to
successfully migrate Locket and Diego data from <code>postgres</code> and into their
respective databases. This guide will mention when downtime approximately
starts and ends.</p>

<p>There are different sets of steps to take depending on your Cloud Foundry
environment.  Please choose the one that matches your deployment, using the
matrix below:</p>

<h2>Standalone Local PostgreSQL</h2>

<p>This process applies if you deployed with the <code>local-db</code> feature.</p>

<h3>Am I Affected?</h3>

<p>Execute the following command, which will grab the tables currently in the
<code>postgres</code> database name.</p>

<pre><code>bosh ssh -e [environment name] -d [deployment name] postgres/0 -rc \
  "/var/vcap/packages/postgres/bin/psql -U vcap -p 5432 postgres -t -c '\dt' 2&gt;&amp;1"
</code></pre>

<p>Next to the column <code>stdout</code>, there will be a list of tables. Look for any of
the following:</p>

<pre><code>public | actual_lrps    | table | diegoadmin
public | configurations | table | diegoadmin
public | desired_lrps   | table | diegoadmin
public | domains        | table | diegoadmin
public | locks          | table | locketadmin
public | tasks          | table | diegoadmin
</code></pre>

<p>If any of your output matches above, you are affected and must follow the rest
of this guide to upgrade to 1.2.0 or beyond.
Otherwise, you can go brew
yourself a cup of tea and pursue other endeavors.</p>

<h3>Step A1: Getting Started</h3>

<p>We'll frequently reference <code>[environment name]</code> and <code>[deployment name]</code> during
this guide. <code>[environment name]</code> refers to the name of your BOSH director where
Cloud Foundry is deployed to. <code>[deployment name]</code> refers to the name of your
Cloud Foundry deployment.</p>

<p>Before starting, ensure your Cloud Foundry deployment is running properly by
running smoke tests. If tests pass, continue onto step 2. Otherwise, please
diagnose and correct your errors; do not continue until smoke tests pass.</p>

<p><em>Once you finish this guide, you will once again execute smoke tests to validate
your Cloud Foundry deployment. It's a good idea to run smoke tests now so that
if your final smoke tests were to fail, you can determine if it was this
migration process that caused it and not previous changes</em></p>

<p>To execute smoke tests, run the following command on your Cloud Foundry
deployment:</p>

<pre><code>bosh -e [environment name] -d [deployment name] run-errand smoke-tests
</code></pre>

<h3>Step A2: Stage Genesis Environment File for Deploy</h3>

<p>The Genesis Cloud Foundry Kit version 1.2.0 includes the fix to GMP-CF-001.
Download it via <code>genesis download cf/1.2.0</code> in your Cloud Foundry deployments
folder. Then, edit your environment file and set <code>version:</code> to
<code>version: 1.2.0</code>. Do not deploy yet, that step will come last.</p>

<h3>Step A3: Stop All BBS VMs</h3>

<p>In order to migrate the data, we first need to stop the processes that access
the affected DB tables. We'll do this via BOSH SSHing into all the BBS
instances</p>

<p>To do so, gather how many BBS instances running via:</p>

<pre><code>bosh -e [environment name] -d [deplyoment name] vms | grep bbs
</code></pre>

<p>This will print out a list of all BBS instances deployed in your CF environment.
With each entry on the list, copy the <code>bbs/instance-guid-here</code> and run:</p>

<pre><code>bosh -e [environment name] -d [deployment name] ssh `bbs/instance-guid-here`
</code></pre>

<p>Once connected to your VM, become the root user:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -i
</code></pre>

<p>Stop all processess on the VM:</p>

<pre><code>monit stop all
</code></pre>

<p>Logout of the root user:</p>

<pre><code>exit
</code></pre>

<p>End the SSH session:</p>

<pre><code>exit
</code></pre>

<p>Repeat these steps for each BBS instance listed from above.</p>

<p>Approximately 2 minutes after stopping all processes on all VMs,routes to your
apps will no longer work and downtime begins.</p>

<h3>Step A4: Connect to your Postgres VM</h3>

<p>To BOSH SSH into your Postgres VM, execute the following:</p>

<pre><code>bosh -e [environment name] -d [deployment name] ssh postgres
</code></pre>

<p>Once connected, become the root user:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -i
</code></pre>

<p>It is necessary to add a directory to your PATH, as the commands in step 4 will
require it. To do so, run:</p>

<pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:/var/vcap/packages/postgres/bin
</code></pre>

<h3>Step A5: Migrate the Data</h3>

<p>We'll need a place to store SQL dumps, so create a directory under the
permanent data directory by running:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /var/vcap/store/migration
cd /var/vcap/store/migration
</code></pre>

<p>Dump the data in the <code>postgres</code> database into files named after their proper
database name:</p>

<pre><code>pg_dump -U vcap -p 5432    -t locks postgres &gt; locketdb.sql;
pg_dump -U vcap -p 5432 -c -t actual_lrps -t configurations -t desired_lrps -t domains -t tasks postgres &gt; diegodb.sql;
</code></pre>

<p>You will then have two files under <code>/var/vcap/store/migration</code>, <code>locket.sql</code>
will contain the Locket database data, and <code>diegodb.sql</code> will contain the Diego
database data.</p>

<p>Now that we've exported the data from <code>postgres</code>, we want to import back into
the properly named databases:</p>

<pre><code>psql -U vcap -p 5432 locketdb &lt; locketdb.sql;
psql -U vcap -p 5432 diegodb  &lt; diegodb.sql;
</code></pre>

<h3>Step A6: Verify the Data Migration was Successful</h3>

<p>To make certain that no GUIDs were changed and that all primary keys stayed the
same, we want to re-export the recently imported data and verify against our
original export:</p>

<pre><code>pg_dump -U vcap -p 5432    -t locks locketdb &gt; locketdb.new.sql;
pg_dump -U vcap -p 5432 -c -t actual_lrps -t configurations -t desired_lrps -t domains -t tasks postgres &gt; diegodb.new.sql;
</code></pre>

<p>Verify the recently exported data has no difference from the originally exported
data:</p>

<pre><code>diff locketdb.sql  locketdb.new.sql;
diff diegodb.sql   diegodb.new.sql;
</code></pre>

<p>If all went well, there should be no output from any of those <code>diff</code> commands.</p>

<h3>Step A7: Rename Old Databases</h3>

<p>Now that we've migrated the data to their proper databases, we want to prevent
any old configurations from referencing data from <code>postgres</code>. To do so:</p>

<pre><code>psql -U vcap -p 5432 postgres -c "ALTER TABLE locks          RENAME TO locks_old";
psql -U vcap -p 5432 postgres -c "ALTER TABLE actual_lrps    RENAME TO actual_lrps_old";
psql -U vcap -p 5432 postgres -c "ALTER TABLE configurations RENAME TO configurations_old";
psql -U vcap -p 5432 postgres -c "ALTER TABLE desired_lrps   RENAME TO desired_lrps_old";
psql -U vcap -p 5432 postgres -c "ALTER TABLE domains        RENAME TO domains_old";
psql -U vcap -p 5432 postgres -c "ALTER TABLE tasks          RENAME TO tasks_old";
</code></pre>

<p>This way, any software that references the old tables should fail, making it
easier to discover improperly configured processes.</p>

<h3>Step A8: Redeploy Genesis Environment</h3>

<p>If all went well, the next step is to redeploy your Cloud Foundry environment
with the v1.2 fix, which will point Locket and Diego to their properly named
databases:</p>

<pre><code>genesis deploy [genesis environment name]
</code></pre>

<p>If all went well, after redeploy BBS will begin running again and routes will
restore within a minute after deploying. Downtime ends here.</p>

<h3>Step A9: Cleanup &amp; Verification (Final step)</h3>

<p>Execute smoke tests to verify that your redeployed Cloud Foundry environment
is operating properly.  Once you are satisfied with the results of the
migration, you may delete the old tables:</p>

<pre><code>psql -U vcap -p 5432 postgres -c "DROP TABLE locks_old CASCADE";
psql -U vcap -p 5432 postgres -c "DROP TABLE actual_lrps_old CASCADE";
psql -U vcap -p 5432 postgres -c "DROP TABLE configurations_old CASCADE";
psql -U vcap -p 5432 postgres -c "DROP TABLE desired_lrps_old CASCADE";
psql -U vcap -p 5432 postgres -c "DROP TABLE domains_old CASCADE";
psql -U vcap -p 5432 postgres -c "DROP TABLE tasks_old CASCADE";
</code></pre>

<h2>Highly-Available Local PostgreSQL</h2>

<p>This process applies if you deployed with the <code>local-ha-db</code> feature.</p>

<h3>Am I Affected?</h3>

<p>Execute the following command, which will grab the tables currently in the
<code>postgres</code> database name.</p>

<pre><code>bosh ssh -e [environment name] -d [deployment name] postgres/0 -rc \
  "/var/vcap/packages/postgres/bin/psql -U vcap -p 6432 postgres -t -c '\dt' 2&gt;&amp;1"
</code></pre>

<p>Next to the column <code>stdout</code>, there will be a list of tables. Look for any of
the following:</p>

<pre><code>public | actual_lrps    | table | diegoadmin
public | configurations | table | diegoadmin
public | desired_lrps   | table | diegoadmin
public | domains        | table | diegoadmin
public | locks          | table | locketadmin
public | tasks          | table | diegoadmin
</code></pre>

<p>If any of your output matches above, you are affected and must follow the rest
of this guide to upgrade to 1.2.0 or beyond.
Otherwise, you can go brew
yourself a cup of tea and pursue other endeavors.</p>

<h3>Step B1: Getting Started</h3>

<p>We'll frequently reference <code>[environment name]</code> and <code>[deployment name]</code> during
this guide. <code>[environment name]</code> refers to the name of your BOSH director where
Cloud Foundry is deployed to. <code>[deployment name]</code> refers to the name of your
Cloud Foundry deployment.</p>

<p>Before starting, ensure your Cloud Foundry deployment is running properly by
running smoke tests. If tests pass, continue onto step 2. Otherwise, please
diagnose and correct your errors; do not continue until smoke tests pass.</p>

<p><em>Once you finish this guide, you will once again execute smoke tests to validate

<pre><code>bosh -e [environment name] -d [deployment name] run-errand smoke-tests
</code></pre>

<h3>Step B2: Stage Genesis Environment File for Deploy</h3>

<p>The Genesis Cloud Foundry Kit version 1.2.0 includes the fix to GMP-CF-0001.
Download it via <code>genesis download cf/1.2.0</code> in your Cloud Foundry deployments
folder. Then, edit your environment file and set <code>version:</code> to
<code>version: 1.2.0</code>. Do not deploy yet, that step will come last.</p>

<h3>Step B3: Stop All BBS VMs</h3>

<p>In order to migrate the data, we first need to stop the processes that access
the affected DB tables. We'll do this via BOSH SSHing into all the BBS

</code></pre>

<p>Once connected to your VM, become the root user:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -i
</code></pre>

<p>Stop all processess on the VM:</p>

<pre><code>monit stop all

<p>Logout of the root user:</p>

<pre><code>exit
</code></pre>

<p>End the SSH session:</p>

<pre><code>exit
</code></pre>

<p>Repeat these steps for each BBS instance listed from above.</p>

<p>Approximately 2 minutes after stopping all processes on all VMs,routes to your
apps will no longer work and downtime begins.</p>

<h3>Step B4: Connect to your Postgres VM</h3>

<p>For Highly-Available PostgreSQL installations, all data manipulation
commands must execute against the write master.  To determine which of your
two <code>postgres/*</code> nodes is the master, execute the following command:</p>

<pre><code>bosh ssh postgres/0 -rc \
  "/var/vcap/packages/postgres/bin/psql -U vcap -p 6432 postgres -t -c 'SELECT pg_is_in_recovery()' 2&gt;&amp;1"
</code></pre>

<p>If the column <code>stdout</code> reads <code>f</code>, then <code>postgres/0</code> is your master. If the printed
output is <code>t</code>, then <code>postgres/1</code> is your master.</p>

<p>To BOSH SSH into your Postgres VM, execute the following, substituting <code>#</code> with
the number of your master node.</p>

<pre><code>bosh -e [environment name] -d [deployment name] ssh postgres/#
</code></pre>

<p>Once connected, become the root user:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -i
</code></pre>

<p>It is necessary to add a directory to your PATH, as the commands in step 4 will
require it. To do so, run:</p>

<pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:/var/vcap/packages/postgres/bin
</code></pre>

<h3>Step B5: Migrate the Data</h3>

<p>We'll need a place to store SQL dumps, so create a directory under the
permanent data directory by running:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /var/vcap/store/migration
cd /var/vcap/store/migration
</code></pre>

<p>Dump the data in the <code>postgres</code> database into files named after their proper
database name:</p>

<pre><code>pg_dump -U vcap -p 6432    -t locks postgres &gt; locketdb.sql;
pg_dump -U vcap -p 6432 -c -t actual_lrps -t configurations -t desired_lrps -t domains -t tasks postgres &gt; diegodb.sql;
</code></pre>

<p>You will then have two files under <code>/var/vcap/store/migration</code>, <code>locket.sql</code>
will contain the Locket database data, and <code>diegodb.sql</code> will contain the Diego
database data.</p>

<p>Now that we've exported the data from <code>postgres</code>, we want to import back into
the properly named databases:</p>

<pre><code>psql -U vcap -p 6432 locketdb &lt; locketdb.sql;
psql -U vcap -p 6432 diegodb  &lt; diegodb.sql;
</code></pre>

<h3>Step B6: Verify the Data Migration was Successful</h3>

<p>To make certain that no GUIDs were changed and that all primary keys stayed the
same, we want to re-export the recently imported data and verify against our
original export:</p>

<pre><code>pg_dump -U vcap -p 6432    -t locks locketdb &gt; locketdb.new.sql;
pg_dump -U vcap -p 6432 -c -t actual_lrps -t configurations -t desired_lrps -t domains -t tasks postgres &gt; diegodb.new.sql;
</code></pre>

<p>Verify the recently exported data has no difference from the originally exported
data:</p>

<pre><code>diff locketdb.sql  locketdb.new.sql;
diff diegodb.sql   diegodb.new.sql;
</code></pre>

<p>If all went well, there should be no output from any of those <code>diff</code> commands.</p>

<h3>Step B7: Rename Old Databases</h3>

<p>Now that we've migrated the data to their proper databases, we want to prevent
any old configurations from referencing data from <code>postgres</code>. To do so:</p>

<pre><code>psql -U vcap -p 6432 postgres -c "ALTER TABLE locks          RENAME TO locks_old";
psql -U vcap -p 6432 postgres -c "ALTER TABLE actual_lrps    RENAME TO actual_lrps_old";
psql -U vcap -p 6432 postgres -c "ALTER TABLE configurations RENAME TO configurations_old";
psql -U vcap -p 6432 postgres -c "ALTER TABLE desired_lrps   RENAME TO desired_lrps_old";
psql -U vcap -p 6432 postgres -c "ALTER TABLE domains        RENAME TO domains_old";
psql -U vcap -p 6432 postgres -c "ALTER TABLE tasks          RENAME TO tasks_old";
</code></pre>

# Introduction

_Migration Processes_ are specific, technical notes, authored by the Genesis
Core Team and Genesis Kit Authors, to provide information on performing data
and configuration migrations from one version of a kit to another.

These processes are not easily automated, and are best served via
documentation.  In some cases, these processes are required to properly
migrate without data loss.  Sometimes they are merely advisory.

Each migration process is given a unique identification, indicating which
Genesis Kit it applies to.  Migration Process numbers will not be
intentionally reused.  Indeed, they are intended to be used in reference
documentation (like Github release notes).

# Cloud Foundry

The following migration processes apply to the Genesis CF Kit, for deploying
Open Source Cloud Foundry instances.

## GMP-CF-0001 - Database Scheme Fix Migration

We recently discovered an issue affecting versions 1.1.0, 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 of
the Genesis CF Kit.   Locket and Diego were incorrectly configured to place
their tables in the `postgres` database, instead of their dedicated
`locketdb` and `diegodb` databases.

While this does not affect day-to-day nominal operation of Cloud Foundry, we
still see this an issue that needs to be corrected as soon as possible.

<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold">This process must be completed in
order to update to version 1.2.0 or newer if your Cloud Foundry environments
were deployed with, or updated to the following versions:</p>

- [Genesis CF Kit v1.1.0](https://github.com/genesis-community/cf-genesis-kit/releases/tag/v1.1.0)
- [Genesis CF Kit v1.1.1](https://github.com/genesis-community/cf-genesis-kit/releases/tag/v1.1.1)
- [Genesis CF Kit v1.1.2](https://github.com/genesis-community/cf-genesis-kit/releases/tag/v1.1.2)

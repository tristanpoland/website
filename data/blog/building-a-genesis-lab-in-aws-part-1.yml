<aside><p><strong>Note:</strong> this is the first in a
series of blog posts on the topic of creating labs in AWS.  Check back in
the next few weeks for the rest of the series.</p></aside>

For this to work, you're going to need an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account,
both parts of an Amazon Access Key ID / Secret Access Key set, and an EC2
(SSH) key pair (which we can generate).



## First Things First: Terraform

We've just released [Genesis Terraforms][tf], a (hopefully growing)
collection of purpose-built Terraform configurations that make it easy to
spin up different bits of cloud infrastructure, on different providers.
Want a production operations tier on GCP?  Genesis Terraforms.  Want to
train a bunch of people on Concourse?  Genesis Terraforms.  Trying to follow
along in a blog post about setting up a lab in AWS?  Genesis Terraforms.

First, you're going to want to clone the git repository.

    $ git clone https://github.com/genesis-community/terraforms

The particular configuration we'll be targeting is in the `lab/aws`
sub-directory.  It requires a few variables, so we'll have to create an
`aws.tfvars` file inside there.

    $ cd terraforms/lab/aws
    $ vim aws.tfvars

Your `tfvars` file will look something like this:

    aws_access_key = "AKI..."
    aws_secret_key = ".. your actual secret key ..."
    aws_vpc_name   = "jhunt-genesis-lab1"
    aws_key_name   = "jhunt-genesis-lab1"
    aws_key_file   = "jhunt-genesis-lab1.pem"

(I'll be flattered if you name your first-deployed VPC after me, really I
will.)

The Access Key and Secret Key will be unique to you.  You can set the VPC
name to anything you want; I like to make mine descriptive so I know what I
can and cannot delete in the AWS console.

That `aws_key_file` needs to be set to the path of the EC2 key pair's
private key component.  If you don't already have one of these, they are
easy enough to generate in the AWS console.  You may want to refer to these
[step-by-step instructions][ec2kp].

Once you've got all that, command the combined power of a thousand robots
with this one simple incantation:

    $ make

That will compile the Terraform plan, taking into account the variables we
just set, and provide you a summary of what is to be done to AWS.  Type
"yes" when prompted and Terraform will go off and deploy a VPC, some
subnets, security groups, a Linux bastion host with an elastic IP, and some
other stuff.

When that's all settled, you should see this:

    Apply complete! Resources: 12 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

    ... some more output ...

    For configuring your proto-BOSH:

      Static IP:       10.4.0.4
      Range (CIDR):    10.4.0.0/24
      Gateway:         10.4.0.1
      DNS:             10.4.0.2

      AWS Region:      us-west-2
      VM Sec. Group:   open-lab
      BOSH Sec. Group: open-lab
      Subnet ID:       subnet-07c0644b5296640a9

    To access the bastion host:

      ssh -i jhunt-genesis-lab1.pem ubuntu@some.ip.addr.ess

Congratulations, you've successfully configured all the IaaS bits!



## Understanding the Lab Topology

So what have we just deployed?  It looks a little something like this:

<img class="full border" src="/blog/aws-lab-1/topology.png">

There are two networks, **DMZ** and **Lab**, which appropriate gateways and
NAT devices to make the Internet traffic work.  Inside the DMZ network
(a 10.4.255.192/26), we have a **bastion host**, which has a public IPv4
address.  This is how we'll get into the VPC to administer it, configure
BOSH, run `genesis` commands, etc.

The two networks can see each other completely; traffic from the DMZ can
pass freely into the interior Lab network, and vice-versa.  Since we're
testing, the security groups are wide-open and the network ACLs (that
firewall out front) are virtually not there.

From the bastion host, we will deploy our (proto-)BOSH director into the Lab
network, and use that BOSH director to deploy our Vault node(s), and
anything else that strikes our fancy.



## Settling Into the Bastion Host

The bastion host has all the software you need to run Genesis, including
Spruce, Vault, the BOSH and CF CLIs, and, of course, `genesis` itself.

<aside><p><strong>Note:</strong> if you ever forget how the IP address of
your bastion host, and don't want to log into the AWS web console to find
out, you can just run

<pre><code>$ make info</code></pre>

To print out the information you got at the end of the initial
Terraforming.</p></aside>

The first time you log into the bastion, you're going to have to do a little
bit of configuration.

    $ sudo jumpbox system

The first command sets up global jumpbox-y things.  It installs a slew of
useful utilities like [safe][safe], [spruce][spruce], [jq][jq], and more.
It also installs required commands like `bosh`, `cf`, and `genesis`.

To see what's installed, just run `jumpbox` with no arguments.

    $ jumpbox
    >> Checking jumpbox installation
       jumpbox installed - jumpbox v55
       ruby installed - ruby 2.5.1p57 (2018-03-29 revision 63029) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
       bosh installed - version 3.0.1-712bfd7-2018-03-13T23:26:43Z
       cf installed - cf version 6.40.1+85d04488a.2018-10-31
       jq installed - jq-1.5
       spruce installed - spruce - Version 1.18.2
       safe installed - safe v0.9.9
       vault installed - Vault v0.9.6 ('7e1fbde40afee241f81ef08700e7987d86fc7242')
       genesis installed - Genesis v2.6.12 (563bd7a7ee) build 20180926.165834
       sipcalc installed - sipcalc 1.1.6

       git user.name  is 'James Hunt'
       git user.email is 'jhunt@starkandwayne.com'

       To bootstrap this installation,  try `jumpbox system`
       To set up your personal environment: `jumpbox user`
       To update this copy of jumpbox, use: `jumpbox sync`
       To create a new local user account:  `jumpbox useradd`



## The Joys of Terminal Multiplexing

One final note before we jump into BOSH and Genesis: `tmux` is an amazing
piece of software.

It's a terminal multiplexer that lets you run lots of terminal sessions,
across a single SSH link.  If you get disconnected, have to reboot your
laptop, or just want to unplug for a long weekend, your tmux session will
still hum along happily on the remote server.

To use tmux, just run `tmux` from the bastion host (that's important!)

It should look something like this:

<img class="full" src="/blog/aws-lab-1/tmux.png">

For the rest of this article, I'm going to assume you're doing everything
from a tmux session.  There's a [tmux cheat sheet][tmux] out there if you
aren't 100% comfortable in tmux.



## Running a Local Vault

Genesis leverages [Hashicorp Vault][vault] to generate and securely store
passwords, SSH keys, X.509 certificates and more.  Once we get a BOSH
director up and running (our very next task, actually), we will use it to
deploy a Vault instance.  Until we get that far, however, we need an
_initial_ Vault to jumpstart the process.

This is where `safe` proves valuable.

Safe (an alternative command-line interface for Vault) provides the means to
run a local Vault instance, on loopback.  It's so easy, we won't have to
worry about configuration, process management, or unsealing / initializing
our nascent Vault.

So, without further ado:

    $ safe local --memory --as init
    Now targeting (temporary) init at http://127.0.0.1:8201
    This Vault is MEMORY-BACKED!
    If you want to retain your secrets be sure to safe export.
    Ctrl-C to shut down the Vault

This gives us a _memory-backed_ Vault, named `init`.  If we kill the process,
we will lose all the secrets.  That might seem like a bad thing, but we only
really have to get through two deployments (about 2 hours wall time), and
a memory-backed initial Vault won't leak credentials as easily.

Once the local Vault is up and running, we can interact with it via `safe`:

    $ safe tree
    $ safe paths

etc.

<aside><p><strong>Remember</strong> to always run the initial Vault inside
of a tmux session.  You don't want to lose all of your credentials just
because you had to close the lid on your laptop and drive home.</p></aside>



## Deploying the proto-BOSH

Before we can begin deploying things with BOSH, we need a BOSH director.
This will be our very first Genesis deployment in this environment, and
we'll use the BOSH `create-env` tooling (under the hood) to get up and
running.

_(If you don't know what create-env is, or have never stood up a BOSH
director, don't worry; we'll walk through every step of the process.)_

In Genesis, a _proto-BOSH_ is the initial deployment.  It is used, in turn,
to deploy both the _operations tier_ (Vault, SHIELD, Concourse, etc.), and
also each of the other _environment BOSH directors_.  Having BOSH deployed
by another BOSH seems a bit weird at first, but it turns out to be a
surprisingly useful optimization.  For one thing, it makes for faster BOSH
director updates.

To deploy something with Genesis, you need a _Kit_.  Kits roll up most of
the tedious bits of configuring BOSH releases into usable deployments.  They
can be a bit opinionated at times, but we think that makes for better
software and systems.

Specifically, we are going to use the (unsurprisingly-named) **BOSH Genesis
Kit**.  Since this our first deployment of BOSH, we're going to initialize a
new set of deployments, using `genesis init` (remember to do this from a
`tmux` session):

    $ mkdir ~/ops
    $ cd ~/ops
    $ genesis init -k bosh
    Downloading Genesis kit bosh (latest version)...

    Initialized empty Genesis repository in /home/ubuntu/ops/bosh-deployments
    using the bosh/1.2.1 kit.

The `genesis init` command creates a _deployments_ directory for the type of
thing you are deploying (in our case, BOSH), and then downloads a Genesis
Kit from GitHub.

Next, we need to write an _environment_ file for our new BOSH director.

    $ cd bosh-deployments
    $ genesis new jhunt-aws

Genesis will then ask a whole bunch of (pertinent) questions about your
configuration, infrastructure / cloud provider, and your preferences.
First up, Genesis needs to know what Vault to store your credentials in:

    Known Vault targets - current target indicated with a (*):
    (*) init         (insecure) http://127.0.0.1:8201

    Which Vault would you like to target?
    > init
    Now targeting init at http://127.0.0.1:8201

The next question is about _proto-BOSH_ vs. _regular BOSH_.  We don't yet
have a BOSH director, so we need to deploy a proto-BOSH.  Say "y" here.

    Is this a proto-BOSH director?
    [y|n] > y

After that, Genesis asks a series of questions about the networking for this
director.  These answers come from our understanding of the Terraform
configuration we deployed.  You can use these values verbatim.

    What static IP do you want to deploy this BOSH director on?
    > 10.4.0.4

    What network should this BOSH director exist in (in CIDR notation)?
    > 10.4.0.0/24

    What default gateway (IP address) should this BOSH director use?
    > 10.4.0.1

    What DNS servers should BOSH use? (leave value empty to end)
    1st value > 10.4.0.2
    2nd value >

To properly configure the BOSH director, Genesis needs to know where we are
deploying (what cloud provider / IaaS).  This is AWS, so answer "2".

    What IaaS will this BOSH director orchestrate?
    1) VMWare vSphere
    2) Amazon Web Services
    3) Microsoft Azure
    4) Google Cloud Platform
    5) OpenStack
    6) BOSH Warden

    Select choice > 2

Now that Genesis knows we're in Amazon, it can ask more pointed questions
about how we expect the BOSH director to access AWS on our behalf.

    What AWS region would you like to deploy to?
    > us-west-2

    What is your AWS Access Key?
    > AKIyourkeyhere...
    Now targeting init at http://127.0.0.1:8201

    What is your AWS Secret Key?
    secret_key [hidden]:
    secret_key [confirm]:

Next up, you will be asked for security groups, and the subnet ID to deploy
the director to.

    What security groups should the all deployed VMs be placed in? (leave value
    empty to end)
    1st value > open-lab
    2nd value >

    What is the ID of the AWS subnet you want to deploy to?
    > subnet-0b79be9eaeb7d164b

    What security groups should the BOSH Director VM be in? (leave value empty
    to end)
    1st value > open-lab
    2nd value >

Hint: you can find the AWS Subnet ID in the output of `make info`.

_(The open-lab security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, on
all ports, to and from all hosts, all protocols.  It won't pass muster on a
production system, but it sure is handy in lab environments.)_

That concludes the question &amp; answer session.

There is one thing to be done manually in the AWS console, and the Genesis
`new` wizard helpfully explains the what, why, and how.

    Before deploying, please be sure to import the keypair
    generated for you from Vault into AWS console.

    First run the following command to get the public key:

        safe get secret/jhunt/aws/bosh/aws/ssh:public

    Then go to EC2 > Key Pairs > Import Key Pair and:

      1. Type 'vcap@jhunt-aws' in the 'Key pair name' input box
      2. Paste the safe command output into the 'Public key contents' input box
      3. Click 'Import' button

    Now you can SSH into VMs deployed by this director
    using the generated key.

So go do that.

Finally, you'll be asked if you want to edit the environment file.  You can
safely say "no" here; we won't be customizing this proto-BOSH.

Now it is Genesis' turn to do some thinking and processing.  You should see
something that looks like this (depending on what you named your
environment):

     - auto-generating credentials (in secret/jhunt/aws/bosh)...
     - auto-generating certificates (in secret/jhunt/aws/bosh)...

    New environment jhunt-aws provisioned!

    To deploy, run this:

      genesis deploy 'jhunt-aws'

Genesis just generated all of the random passwords and required X.509
certificates that a functioning BOSH director needs.  Isn't that neat?

Literally all you have to do is run that `genesis deploy` command.

    $ genesis deploy jhunt-aws

When that finishes, follow the on-screen instructions and log into the BOSH
director:

    $ genesis do jhunt-aws -- login
    Running login addon for jhunt-aws
    Logging you in as user 'admin'...
    Using environment 'https://10.4.0.4:25555'

    Email (): admin
    Password ():

    Successfully authenticated with UAA

    Succeeded



## Preparing the Director

The BOSH director is deployed, but before we can use it to deploy something,
we need to do two things.

1. Upload a Xenial Stemcell
2. Install a valid Cloud Config

### Uploading Stemcells

The BOSH Genesis Kit sports this wonderful addon called _upload-stemcells_
that provides a menu driven interface for selecting and uploading stemcells
(the stuff deployment VMs are made of).  It properly limits which stemcell
variants are considered, based on the IaaS you configured the director for.

Since we're going to need a stemcell, let's take it for a spin!

    $ genesis do jhunt-aws -- upload-stemcells

This will show you the major and minor versions of the Xenial stemcell
series (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) for AWS, and let you pick which you want to
upload.  The upload is handed off to the BOSH director, and when you get
back to a prompt you should be good to go.

I tested with Xenial 97.x (latest minor revision).

### Configuring Clouds

BOSH Cloud Config is one of the more arcane and esoteric parts of BOSH.
To help make this easier, the **Genesis Terraforms** repository can build a
rudimentary, baseline cloud config, if you ask it to.

From wherever you ran the Terraforming process, run:

    $ make cc

That will print out a cloud config YAML document that you can transfer to
the bastion host, and use that to `bosh update-cloud-config`.

This cloud config defines a `default` network, some generic VM types (small,
medium, large), a default disk type, and a single availability zone (z1).
It should suffice to get us through the next deployment, and since this is a
lab, you're probably going to modify it eventually anyway!



## Deploying the Vault

Now that we have a BOSH director, a stemcell, and a cloud config, we can
deploy a real Vault to replace the ephemeral `safe local` Vault we've been
using up to now.  We'll repeat the same dance of `genesis init` / `genesis
new`, only this time, for the **Vault Genesis Kit**.

    $ cd ~/ops
    $ genesis init -k vault
    $ cd vault-deployments
    $ genesis new jhunt-aws

The Vault kit is mercifully less chatty than the BOSH Director kit, so there
isn't much in the way of questions to answer during `genesis new`.  We will
be asked if this is the _Genesis Vault_.  It is, so answer "y" to that one.

If you try to deploy the Vault now (go ahead, I'll wait) it will fail,
because the Vault Kit expects to deploy a highly-available cluster across
three different availability zones.  Our lab only has one AZ, so it doesn't
work.

Not a big deal, all we have to do is open up the `jhunt-aws.yml` file (in
`vault-deployments/`) in our favorite editor, and add this to the `params:`
stanza:

    params:
      availability_zones: [z1]
      stemcell_os: ubuntu-xenial

Changing `stemcell_os` is also necessary, because (at least as of 1.2.1) the
Vault Kit expects to deploy to the latest Ubuntu Trusty (14.04 LTS), but we
only uploaded Xenial stemcells.

Now we can deploy.

    $ genesis deploy jhunt-aws

After the deployment succeeds, we need to initialize the Vault:

    $ genesis do jhunt-aws -- init

This sets up a safe target in your local configuration, named `jhunt-aws`
(after the environment).  We are now able to transfer all of our
credentials from the ephemeral `init` Vault to their forever home.

    $ safe -T init export | safe -T jhunt-aws import

It is now safe to kill the `safe local` process.

Congratulations! 

<p class="emoji">🎉</p>



## Neat!  Now What?

Hopefully you've had fun setting up this little AWS lab.  The BOSH director
we deployed has Credhub installed, so you're able to deploy whatever you
want to it, with or without the power of Genesis.

If you do think Genesis is awesome sauce, check out the other kits and see
if anything tickles your fancy.  Official Genesis Kits live on GitHub, in
the [Genesis Community organization][gh-gc].  Notable Kits include:

  - **[Concourse][concourse-kit]** - Deploy a CI/CD pipeline and get started
    with automating your Genesis deployments!

  - **[SHIELD][shield-kit]** - A data protection solution for the cloud.
    Schedule backups and perform restores on databases, key-value stores,
    even file systems.

  - **[Cloud Foundry][cf-kit]** - The Cloud Foundry PaaS itself.  Now
    deployed via Genesis.

  - **[Blacksmith][blacksmith-kit]** - Data services, on-demand, leveraging
    BOSH.  Available for CF marketplaces and Kubernetes!

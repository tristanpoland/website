BOSH is an infrastructure-agnostic VM-management tool that manages the entire lifecycle of your VMs
and resurrects them if they fail. All of these features come at the cost of complexity.

Enter Genesis. 

Genesis is a tool and paradigm for easily managing complex BOSH deployments.
But you won't have any BOSH deployments if you don't first have BOSH, so 
Genesis also allows users to easily deploy a BOSH director in the first place.

This blog post will walk you through using genesis to deploy a BOSH director on vSphere.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for following along with these steps are:
    1.) Access to VCenter. During experimentation, admin credentials are ok. In production, 
        use a vCenter accout with the [minimum required vSphere Permissions][vsphere-perms]
    2.) A Linux bastion host running in vSphere that can be accessed via SSH. This host
        must be able to access the internet and the desired IP of the soon-to-be BOSH director. 
        We will walk through configuring this bastion host below. 

## First Things First: Gathering the necessary information about your VSphere installation

BOSH requires some basic knowledge about your vSphere installation in
order to deploy. We'll need to go ahead and jot down that information
now, so that we can reference it later in this guide.

*First*, you'll need your vCenter hostname (or IP address) and its login credentials.

*Second*, you'll need the name of the cluster that we'll deploy BOSH to. You can find
this out through the dropdown Menu > Hosts and Clusters and then
clicking on the Hosts & Clusters page. A list of available clusters
will populate the page; write down the name of the cluster you wish to
deploy your BOSH to.

*Third*, you'll need to get the datastore information by clicking on
the Datastores tab. A list of available datastores will populate the page;
write down the name of the datastore you wish to deploy your BOSH within.
You'll want one with at least a few hundred gigabytes free.

*Fourth* and finally, you'll need the name of the network that your BOSH director will
be deployed to and do its own deploying to.

## Setting Up Your Bastion Host

All of the commands that we'll run to deploy BOSH should be run from a bastion host deployed
as a VM to your VSphere. This should be built from a Linux image of your choosing. 

Once your bastion host is deployed, install all of the tools you'll need by running the following: 

    sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/jumpbox https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starkandwayne/jumpbox/master/bin/jumpbox
    sudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/jumpbox
    jumpbox system
   
This installs genesis itself, as well as a few other command line tools that 
are required, such as [safe][safe], [spruce][spruce], [jq][jq], and
more. To see a full list of what was installed,
just run `jumpbox` with no arguments.

Next, configure git:

    git config --global	user.name "YOURNAME"
    git config --global user.email "YOUREMAIL"

## The Joys of Terminal Multiplexing

One final note before we jump into BOSH and Genesis: `tmux` is an
amazing piece of software.

It's a terminal multiplexer that lets you run lots of terminal
sessions, across a single SSH link.  If you get disconnected, have to
reboot your laptop, or just want to unplug for a long weekend, your
tmux session will still hum along happily on the remote server.

To use tmux, just run `tmux` from the bastion host (that's important!)

It should look something like this:

<img class="full" src="/blog/aws-lab-1/tmux.png">

For the rest of this article, I'm going to assume you're doing
everything from a tmux session.  There's a [tmux cheat sheet][tmux]
out there if you aren't 100% comfortable in tmux.

## Running a Local Vault

Genesis leverages [Hashicorp Vault][vault] to generate and securely
store passwords, SSH keys, X.509 certificates and more.  Once we get a
BOSH director up and running (our very next task, actually), we will
use it to deploy a Vault instance.  Until we get that far, however, we
need an _initial_ Vault to jumpstart the process.

This is where `safe` proves valuable.

Safe (an alternative command-line interface for Vault) provides the
means to run a local Vault instance, on loopback.  It's so easy, we
won't have to worry about configuration, process management, or
unsealing / initializing our nascent Vault.

So, without further ado:

    $ safe local --memory --as init Now targeting (temporary) init at
    http://127.0.0.1:8201 This Vault is MEMORY-BACKED! If you want to
    retain your secrets be sure to safe export. Ctrl-C to shut down
    the Vault

This gives us a _memory-backed_ Vault, named `init`.  If we kill the
process, we will lose all the secrets.  That might seem like a bad
thing, but we only really have to get through two deployments (about 2
hours wall time), and a memory-backed initial Vault won't leak
credentials as easily.

Once the local Vault is up and running, we can interact with it via
`safe`:

    $ safe tree 
    $ safe paths

etc.

<aside><p><strong>Remember</strong> to always run the initial Vault
inside of a tmux session.  You don't want to lose all of your
credentials just because you had to close the lid on your laptop and
drive home.</p></aside>

## Deploying BOSH

To deploy anything with Genesis, you use a _Kit_. Kits abstract away the complexity of configuring
BOSH releases and BOSH manifests. 

Specifically, we are going to use the (unsurprisingly-named) **BOSH
Genesis Kit**.  Since this our first deployment of BOSH, we're going
to initialize a new set of deployments, using `genesis init` (remember
to do this from a `tmux` session):

    $ mkdir ~/ops 
    $ cd ~/ops $ genesis init -k BOSH Downloading
    Genesis kit BOSH (latest version)...

    Initialized empty Genesis repository in
    /home/ubuntu/ops/BOSH-deployments using the BOSH/1.2.1 kit.

The `genesis init` command creates a _deployments_ directory for the
type of thing you are deploying (in our case, BOSH), and then
downloads a Genesis Kit from GitHub.

Next, we need to write an _environment_ file for our new BOSH
director.

    $ cd BOSH-deployments $ genesis new test-vsphere

Genesis will then ask a whole bunch of (pertinent) questions about
your configuration, infrastructure / cloud provider, and your
preferences. First up, Genesis needs to know what Vault to store your
credentials in:

    Known Vault targets - current target indicated with a (*): (*)
    init         (insecure) http://127.0.0.1:8201

    Which Vault would you like to target? > init Now targeting init at
    http://127.0.0.1:8201

The next question is about _proto-BOSH_ vs. _regular BOSH_. A proto-BOSH director
is the root level BOSH in a genesis deployment. We don't
yet have a BOSH director, so we need to deploy a proto-BOSH.  Say "y"
here.

    Is this a proto-BOSH director? [y|n] > y

After that, Genesis asks a series of questions about the networking
for this director.  These answers completely depend on the network setup 
and IP allocation on your vCenter. The values provided below are just examples. 

    What static IP do you want to deploy this BOSH director on? >
    10.4.0.4

    What network should this BOSH director exist in (in CIDR
    notation)? > 10.4.0.0/24

    What default gateway (IP address) should this BOSH director use? >
    10.4.0.1

    What DNS servers should BOSH use? (leave value empty to end) 1st
    value > 10.4.0.2 2nd value >

To properly configure the BOSH director, Genesis needs to know where
we are deploying (what cloud provider / IaaS).  This is AWS, so answer
"2".

    What IaaS will this BOSH director orchestrate? 1) VMWare vSphere
    2) Amazon Web Services 3) Microsoft Azure 4) Google Cloud Platform
    5) OpenStack 6) BOSH Warden

    Select choice > 1

Now that Genesis knows we're in vSphere, it can ask more pointed
questions about how we expect the BOSH director to access vCenter on our
behalf. Have the information about your vSphere that we noted earlier on hand and 
these questions will be a breeze. 

    What is the IP address of your VMWare vCenter Server Appliance? >
    your_director_ip

    What username should BOSH use to authenticate with vCenter? > 
    your_vsphere_usrname

    What is the password for the vCenter user? >
    password [hidden]:
    password [confirm]:

    What vCenter data center do you want to BOSH to deploy to? >
    your_data_center_name

    What vCenter cluster do you want BOSH to deploy to? > 
    your_cluster_name

    What vCenter resource pool (if any) do you want BOSH to deploy to? (default: none) > 
    none or your_resource_pool_name

    What data stores do you wish to use for ephemeral (OS) disks? (leave value empty to end)
    1st value > your_data_store_name
    2nd value >

    Do you wish to use these same data stores for persistent (data) disks?
    [y|n] > y

    What is the name of the VM network in vCenter to deploy BOSH to? > your_VM_network_name

    Would you like to edit the environment file?
    [y|n] > n

Finally, you'll be asked if you want to edit the environment file.
You can safely say "no" here; we won't be customizing this proto-BOSH.

Now it is Genesis' turn to do some thinking and processing.  You
should see something that looks like this (depending on what you named
your environment):

     - auto-generating credentials (in secret/test/vsphere/BOSH)... -
     auto-generating certificates (in secret/test/vsphere/BOSH)...

    New environment test-vsphere provisioned!

    To deploy, run this:

      genesis deploy 'test-vsphere'

Genesis just generated all of the random passwords and required X.509
certificates that a functioning BOSH director needs.

Now all you have to do is run the `genesis deploy` command.

    $ genesis deploy test-vsphere

When that finishes, follow the on-screen instructions and log into the
BOSH director:

    $ genesis do test-vsphere -- login Running login addon for test-vsphere
    Logging you in as user 'admin'... Using environment
    'https://10.4.0.4:25555'

    Email (): admin Password ():

    Successfully authenticated with UAA

    Succeeded

Then continue following the instructions to upload a stemcell.

### Cloud Config

BOSH Cloud Config is a file that specifies the details of the infrastructure
that BOSH has available to deploy VMs to. It is  one of the more arcane and esoteric parts of
BOSH. On other infrastructures, Genesis provides the ability to use Terraform
to provision the necessary resources for Genesis, and then output a corresponding cloud config.
Since the use case for Terraform on vSphere is less straight-forward, one isn't provided and instead 
a starter cloud-config is provided here:

    azs:
    - name: z1
    cloud_properties:
        datacenters:
        - clusters: [z1: {}]

    vm_types:
    - name: default
    cloud_properties:
        cpu: 2
        ram: 1024
        disk: 3240
    - name: large
    cloud_properties:
        cpu: 2
        ram: 4096
        disk: 30_240

    disk_types:
    - name: default
    disk_size: 3000
    - name: large
    disk_size: 50_000

    networks:
    - name: default
    type: manual
    subnets:
    - range: CIDR-FOR-DESIRED-IP-BLOCK
        gateway: YOUR-GATEWAY-IP
        az: z1
        dns: [YOUR-DNS-IP-ADDRESS(ES)]
        cloud_properties:
        name: YOUR-NETWORK-NAME

    compilation:
    workers: 5
    reuse_compilation_vms: true
    az: z1
    vm_type: large
    network: default

Save this cloud config to a file named `cloud-config.yml`, fill in the placeholders with the values for 
your infrastructure, and then run: 

     bosh -e test-vsphere update-cloud-config control-plane.yml

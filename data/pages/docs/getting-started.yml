# Plan The Environments

These days, several people seem to think you should be able to run a few
commands, get a BOSH director up and running, and then figure out what to do
with it.

We prefer a little more planning up-front, to save a lot of rework later on
down the line.

# How Many, and Where?

How many Cloud Foundries do you want to run?  We recommend, at a
minimum, the following:

  1. **Sandbox** - A small environment for you and your immediate team to
     experiment with.

  2. **Development** - Some place for your application developers to play,
     before they get to production.

  3. **Production** - The real deal; where all the magic happens.  Deploy
     often to keep it updated, but don't touch it until you've experimented
     in lower environments.

You might want these other environments too:

  4. **QA** - Somewhere in between dev and prod lies QA, where end-to-end
     testing by skilled human beings occurs.

  5. **Staging** - Between QA and prod, staging provides an environment for
     staging your production changes.  If you can justify the cost, treating
     this environment as a copy of production that you route traffic to
     lends itself to blue/green methodologies on a grand scale.

It's also 100% okay to have more than one of each of these.  Multiple
production environments, in different clouds or in different geographic
regions (or both!) can be useful for different markets, or for geo-routed
services.  If you outgrow a dev environment, you can also spin up another.
The important part is to _think about it_ and have a plan.

# Networks and Sizing

A crucial aspect of planning your environments is understanding how many
networks you have / need, and how big they ought to be.

## The Operations Tier

Normally, an operations tier can get away with a single `/24` (254 hosts),
`/25` (126 hosts) or even a `/26` (62 hosts) network.

<table class="listing">
  <thead><tr>
    <th>Component</th>
    <th># of IPs</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Bastion Host</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>
        <p>This IP must be statically assigned, before BOSH is stood up.
           (Terraform will normally do this for you).
           For that reason, you will need to reserve it from the network
           definitions in your cloud-config, so that BOSH doesn't try to
           hand it out to a VM that it deploys.</p>
       </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>proto-BOSH</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>
        <p>This IP must be statically assigned, before BOSH is stood up.
           This is done during configuration of the proto-BOSH Genesis
           environment.</p>
       </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Vault</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>
        <p>Vault is a 3-node Consul-cluster.</p>
       </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>SHIELD</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>
        <p></p>
       </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Prometheus</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>
        <p></p>
       </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Concourse</td>
      <td>5+</td>
      <td>
        <p>A minimum of three (3) VMs must be deployed (the TSA+ATC, the database,
           and one worker).  We recommend at least two workers, preferably three,
           which brings you to five (5) IPs total.</p>
       </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

At a minimum, the recommended configuration needs **12** IPs.  Which means
the _smallest_ network you can shoehorn an operations tier into is a `/28`
(14 hosts).  You will probably want to reserve more, to allow for future
expansion.

## Cloud Foundry

The Cloud Foundry Genesis Kit deploys across four networks:

  - **internal** - Contains the core bits and pieces of Cloud Foundry,
    including UAA, CAPI, etc.

  - **edge** - The externally-facing parts of Cloud Foundry, on the
    perimeter of the architecture.

  - **runtime** - Diego, where the application containers run.  This is
    split off from the rest of the core to allow firewalls to be placed
    around the runtime and keep CF applications from abusing access to
    things like CAPI or the UAA.

  - **db** - The internal database, if one is deployed.

The sizes of each of these four networks depends on how big you need to make
the overall Cloud Foundry installation.

### Internal Network

Most of the managerial parts of Cloud Foundry exist in the _internal_
network.  These are components that need to talk to one another, but do not
need to be access by application containers, or the outside world, directly.

<table class="listing">
  <thead><tr>
    <th>Component</th>
    <th># of IPs</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>NATS</td>
      <td>2+</td>
      <td>The NATS message bus is still used for router advertisements.
      Scaling it horizontally only adds redundancy.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>API</td>
      <td>2+</td>
      <td>The Cloud Controller API itself.  Scale this horizontally
      to achieve more a more responsive CLI experience.
      <em>Hosted behind gorouter.</em></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>UAA</td>
      <td>2+</td>
      <td>The authorization and authentication server.  Scale this
      horizontally for faster login / account rights lookups.
      <em>Hosted behind gorouter.</em></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Doppler</td>
      <td>2+</td>
      <td>Part of the Cloud Foundry Logging subystem.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Syslogger</td>
      <td>2+</td>
      <td>Part of the Cloud Foundry Logging subystem.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>LTC</td>
      <td>2+</td>
      <td>Part of the Cloud Foundry Logging subystem.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>BBS</td>
      <td>2+</td>
      <td>The bulletin board system, where Diego stores all of its state
      information.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Diego</td>
      <td>2+</td>
      <td>This is <strong>not</strong> the Diego runtime (cells); this is
      the non-BBS bits of Diego that constitute the brains of Diego.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Smoke Tests (errand)</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>This "VM" doesn't exist unless you are running the smoke-tests
      errand (which you should), but you need to plan for it.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Edge Network

This network exists as a separate contiguous blog of IPs to allow for
different firewalling.  Outside load balancers need to be able to talk to
the virtual machines in this network, since they form the <em>perimeter</em>
of the Cloud.

<table class="listing">
  <thead><tr>
    <th>Component</th>
    <th># of IPs</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>gorouter</td>
      <td>2+</td>
      <td>The routing layer, for getting HTTP(S) requests and TCP
      connections to the appropriate Diego container.  Scales with
      the cluster as the number of concurrent requests per second grows.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Access</td>
      <td>2+</td>
      <td>Provides <kbd>cf ssh</kbd> access to application containers
      in Diego; scales as the number of these requests increases,
      which means you probably won't need to scale it very often.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Database Network

The database is cordoned off in its own network to ensure that the highest
level of firewall protections can be afforded to the VMs that store the
sensitive data of a Cloud Foundry instance.

<table class="listing">
  <thead><tr>
    <th>Component</th>
    <th># of IPs</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>DB</td>
      <td>1-2</td>
      <td>The PostgreSQL database instance(s).  For local non-HA mode, you
      only need one IP.  If you opt for HA, you need two.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Runtime Network

All of the applications that will be pushed into Cloud Foundry will execute
on the VMs in the <em>runtime network</em>, to allow them to be sequestered
from the rest of the infrastructure as needed.

<table class="listing">
  <thead><tr>
    <th>Component</th>
    <th># of IPs</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Diego Cell</td>
      <td>3+</td>
      <td>This <strong>will</strong> scale as you need more space to host
      application containers.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


# The Operations Tier

The first thing we need to install is the operations tier.  This includes
things like our Vault, the Concourse installation, and proto-BOSH.  The rest
of this guide assumes you have a bastion host inside your IaaS network, or
appropriate firewall rules / security groups in place to allow all of the
access you need.  It also assumes that you have Genesis installed.

## Bootstrapping proto-BOSH

The first thing we're going to need is a Vault.  But since we use BOSH (via
a Genesis Kit) to deploy it, we're going to need a BOSH director first.  We
can create one (referred to as a _proto-BOSH_) using Genesis, but then we
are at an impasse -- we need a Vault to generate and store credentials for
this proto-BOSH, but we need the proto-BOSH to deploy the Vault.

Enter `safe local`.

With [safe](https://github.com/starkandwayne/safe/releases), you can set up
a local, ephemeral Vault instance and begin to use it in place of the actual
Vault you'll deploy soon.

    $ safe local --memory
    Now targeting (temporary) toughened-refuge at http://127.0.0.1:8201
    This Vault is MEMORY-BACKED!
    If you want to retain your secrets be sure to safe export.
    Ctrl-C to shut down the Vault

The name of your local Vault will vary.

**Note:** the local Vault runs in the foreground, so you will want to either
run it under something like [tmux][tmux], or open up another terminal shell
/ SSH session.

Once the local Vault is up and running, we can interact with it via `safe`:

    $ safe tree
    $ safe paths

You're now ready to configure and deploy your proto-BOSH, via the **BOSH**
Genesis Kit.  Kits roll up most of the tedious bits of configuring BOSH
releases into usable deployments.  They can be a bit opinionated at times,
but we think that makes for better software and systems.

    $ mkdir ~/ops
    $ cd ~/ops
    $ genesis init -k bosh
    Downloading Genesis kit bosh (latest version)...

    Initialized empty Genesis repository in /home/u/ops/bosh-deployments
    using the bosh/1.3.0 kit.

The `genesis init` command creates a _deployments_ directory for the type of
thing you are deploying (in our case, BOSH), and then downloads a Genesis
Kit from GitHub.

Next, we need to write an _environment_ file for our new BOSH director.

    $ cd bosh-deployments
    $ genesis new ops

Genesis will then ask a whole bunch of (pertinent) questions about your
configuration, infrastructure / cloud provider, and your preferences.
First up, Genesis needs to know what Vault to store your credentials in:

    Known Vault targets - current target indicated with a (*):
    (*) toughened-refuge    (insecure) http://127.0.0.1:8201

    Which Vault would you like to target?
    > toughened-refuge
    Now targeting init at http://127.0.0.1:8201

The next question is about _proto-BOSH_ vs. _regular BOSH_.  We are
deploying a proto-BOSH:

    Is this a proto-BOSH director?
    [y|n] > y

After that, Genesis asks a series of questions about the networking for this
director.  These answers will vary based on your IaaS and networking
choices.

To deploy, just run:

    $ genesis deploy ops

When that finishes, follow the on-screen instructions and log into the BOSH
director:

    $ genesis do ops -- login
    Running login addon for ops
    Logging you in as user 'admin'...
    Using environment 'https://10.4.0.4:25555'

    Email (): admin
    Password ():

    Successfully authenticated with UAA

    Succeeded

Before we can start using our new proto-BOSH, we need to [upload
stemcells][bosh-sc] and [install a cloud-config][bosh-cc].  Please refer to
the appropriate [bosh.io][bosh-io] documentation.


## Installing the Vault

Equipped with our brand new proto-BOSH, we can now deploy our Vault, and
move all of the credentials and X.509 certificates into that.

    $ cd ~/ops
    $ genesis init -k vault
    Downloading Genesis kit vault (latest version)...

    Initialized empty Genesis repository in /home/u/ops/vault-deployments
    using the vault/1.4.0 kit.

As before, we're going to create a new **environment** for Genesis:

    $ cd ~/ops/vault-deployments
    $ genesis new ops
    Now targeting toughened-refuge at http://127.0.0.1:8201

    Setting up new environment ops...

    Is this your Genesis Vault (for storing deployment credentials)?
    [y|n] > y

Make sure to answer **y** when asked if this Vault will store your Genesis
credentials (because it will!)

Now we can deploy it (from `~/ops/vault-deployments`):

    $ genesis deploy ops

Once it's up and running, the last step is to initialize the Vault and get
it ready for production use.

    $ genesis do ops -- init


## Switching Vaults

Now that we have our actual Vault up and running, we need to get the secrets
that we put into our ephemeral Vault into our persistent, production Vault.

Thankfully, `safe` can help us out here too:

    $ safe -T toughened-refuge export |\
      safe -T ops-vault import

Tada!


## Deploying SHIELD

Now that you've got data (Vault stuff _AND_ BOSH stuff!) you're going to
want a way to back that up.  For that, we have the **SHIELD** Genesis Kit:

    $ cd ~/ops
    $ genesis init -k shield
    Downloading Genesis shield vault (latest version)...

    Initialized empty Genesis repository in /home/u/ops/shield-deployments
    using the shield/0.5.0 kit.

Again, we're going to create a new **environment** for Genesis:

    $ cd ~/ops/shield-deployments
    $ genesis new ops
    Now targeting ops at https://10.4.0.6

    Setting up new environment ops...

    What IP address would you like to deploy SHIELD on?
    > 10.4.0.77

    Would you like to authenticate against an OAuth2 endpoint (Github / UAA)?
    [y|n] > n

And finally, deploy:

    $ genesis deploy ops

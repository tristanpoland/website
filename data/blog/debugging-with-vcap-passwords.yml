A well-tuned BOSH director is a thing of beauty.  When all the pieces and
parts are humming and clicking properly, everything just works and you start
to forget that provisioning operating systems and software stacks,
especially in the cloud provider of your choice, was ever difficult in the
first place.

But sometimes you are going to have to debug all that magic, and it's good
to know where to start.

A well-tuned BOSH director is a thing of beauty.  When all the pieces and

## Meet The T3, Same As The T2

On August 21st, 2018, [Amazon introduced T3][t3], the next round of upgrades
to the T-series of instance types that include the venerable t2.micro, and
the miserly t2.nano.  If you, like me, do a lot of cloud demos and want to
keep costs down, you've probably run into a Tx.something or five.

I just so happened to be sitting down to fire up a lab for installing
Genesis when I saw the announcement, so I decided to take them for a spin.
I was also working through writing [distributable Terraform configurations
for Genesis][tf] and so I incorporated the T3's into the cloud
configuration template, deployed a VPC, and promptly forgot about the
instance type.

All was not well, however, and my first deployment on the demo BOSH director
was failing to compile packages, with this error:

    Task 21 | 14:08:28 | Compiling packages: vault/4f754614313fc27928476ec02e248efd1622c94d (00:15:33)
                   L Error: Timed out pinging to 4a320dab-328d-48d0-bd6f-f7776f821b53 after 600 seconds

We see this a lot when networking is wonky; firewalls, bad NAT
configurations, AWS security groups shenanigans can all cause this.  When
BOSH says it's _pinging_ the instance, it's actually waiting patiently for
the instance to send an "All Good" on the BOSH NATS message bus.

In Amazon, I can use my EC2 SSH key pair to remotely access the instance, as
the `vcap` user:

    SSH_AUTH_SOCK= ssh -i 'vcap@jhunt-aws.pem' vcap@10.4.0.193

(`vcap@jhunt-aws.pem` is just what I named the private key file.  I also
unset `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` because I have a lot of keys in my SSH agent, and I
don't want to run out of authentication attempts.)

That lets me in just fine.  The instance is clearly being created, and there
are at least no weird networking restrictions between my jumpbox and the
compilation VM.  We need to dig in more.

The next step is to review the BOSH agent logs (in `/var/vcap/bosh/logs`)
and see what the agent is doing, but to do that I need root privileges.

    $ sudo -i
    Password for vcap:

Dang.  So close.  I don't _know_ what the vcap user's password is.
Normally, BOSH randomizes it for each instance it deploys, to help secure
the entire platform.  We need to knock that off for a bit, since it is
interfering with our troubleshooting.


## A Detour To "Soften" The VMs

To get our sudo back in working order, we have to _soften up_ these VMs a
little bit, in the security department.

First, we are going to need a suitable, _encrypted_ password:

    $6$lFvaAqSVJbrigByR$XRtYFRHw2CdNQ54g3sCew5aNpRIrU9gPC8lY8b6ZVM8Er9j16HNyIlJERj4RAPf96p8Ggn/94PUrzEJot0nV4/

BOSH can set a password for the vcap user, if you give it one in
[`crypt(3)` / `shadow(5)` format][crypt].  In case you don't read the
SHA-512 dialect of crypt, that says "debug".

Now, we just need to inject that into the deployment recipe, via cloud
config.  Because I'm specifically troubleshooting my compilation VMs, I'm
putting this in the `compilation:` stanza.

    compilation:
      #
      # ... the rest of the compilation block ...
      #

      env:
        bosh:
          password: $6$lFvaAqSVJbrigByR$XRtYFRHw2CdNQ54g3sCew5aNpRIrU9gPC8lY8b6ZVM8Er9j16HNyIlJERj4RAPf96p8Ggn/94PUrzEJot0nV4/

You can also put the `env:` stuff in your `instance_groups:` stanza in the
deployment manifest, if you're okay to compile but having similar "pinging"
issues elsewhere.

One re-deploy later, and I'm back on a new (failing) compilation VM,
**ONLY THIS TIME I CAN SUDO!**

    $ SSH_AUTH_SOCK= ssh -i 'vcap@jhunt-aws.pem' vcap@10.4.0.193
    $ sudo -i
    Password for vcap: (debug)

    # whoami
    root

Now we're getting somewhere.

## Remember that T3?

Turns out the T3 line _is not at all_ the same as the T2.  Namely, the disk
device names under `/dev/` are all kinds of different; `nvme*` instead of
`sd*`.  My stemcell was too old for that kind of change, and the BOSH agent
was quite insistent on mounting `/dev/sdb` and `/dev/sdf`, which just plain
weren't there.

Here's the relevant log snippet, in case it helps:

    2018-11-08_15:53:49.01246 [File System] 2018/11/08 15:53:49 DEBUG - Checking if file exists /dev/xvdb

    2018-11-08_15:53:49.11265 [File System] 2018/11/08 15:53:49 DEBUG - Stat '/dev/sdb'

Luckily, I was able to get into the compilation VM via SSH, and diagnose the
problem in under two hours.  And the demo lived happily ever after, the end.

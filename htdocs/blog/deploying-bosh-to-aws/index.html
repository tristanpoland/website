      <p>Do you have an Amazon AWS account?  Do you with things were more
automated and just easier to manage? Want to do that using BOSH, but wish
there was a simple way to deploy BOSH? Me too. So, let's do that.</p>

<h2>Why BOSH?</h2>

<p>Before you can do anything in the Genesis ecosystem, you really need a BOSH
director.  But why is Genesis so enamoured with BOSH?</p>

<p>Simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>Orchestration</li>
<li>Cloud Portability</li>
<li>Self-Healing</li>
<li>Separation of Concerns</li>
</ol>

<p>BOSH is, first and foremost, an <strong>orchestrator</strong> of virtual machines.  You
tell it what you want deployed, and it handles all the nitty-gritty details
of spooling up compute and memory resources, storage volumes, etc.</p>

<p>We're going to use Amazon AWS EC2 instances in this tutorial, but that's not
the whole of BOSH's unique bag of tricks.  Through the abstraction of a
<em>cloud provider interface</em> (or "CPI" if you prefer TLAs), BOSH supports a
whole range of cloud infrastructures, including Microsoft Azure, Google
Cloud Platform, VMware vSphere ESXi, and more.  The best part?  You don't
have to do anything terribly special to move a deployment manifest (the
recipe you give BOSH that tells it how to deploy stuff) from one cloud to
another!</p>

<p>But BOSH does way more than just stand up new VMs.  It keeps a watchful eye
(a tedious task that only a robot does well) on all the machines it deploys,
and if they go away, it replaces them with new instances.  This is critical
for running large distributed systems (like Cloud Foundry), since individual
VMs can go missing for a variety of reasons:  the cloud provider loses the
instance, software crashes, etc.  BOSH notices these types of outages and
happily provisions replacement machines and puts them into service.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>separation of concerns</strong> becomes increasingly important as we
transition into the <em>day 2 operations</em> phase of running a platform.  With
BOSH, there are two types of updates: <em>OS updates</em> and <em>release updates</em>.</p>

<p>The majority of security patches are going to come through the former
channel.  As upstream OS vendors (Canonical, Microsoft, etc.) upgrade core
system components like the kernel, OpenSSL libraries, etc., the BOSH team
is building updated <em>stemcells</em> that roll all of those changes up into a
nice, versioned package that operators can deploy.  These stemcells are
wholly independent of any of the software we deploy (like Kubernetes).</p>

<p>Application-specific security patches, as well as bug fixes and new
features, come through the latter channel.  For example, when the Cloud
Foundry UAA team patches UAA, they release a new <em>BOSH release</em> that we can
then deploy on top of our existing stemcells.</p>

<p>Taken together, these two avenues of updates allow operators to choose when
and how to patch their systems, based on business need, security posture,
and risk tolerance.  When you're running a platform with thousands of
customers, atop hundreds of VMs, this becomes a luxury you'll not want to go
without.</p>

<p>That's why Genesis loves BOSH so much.</p>

<h2>What We're Going To Build</h2>

<p>We are going to assume that you are starting out with nothing deployed in
Amazon AWS, and work our way up to a BOSH director that you can use (in
concert with Genesis) to deploy all kinds of other fun things.</p>

<p>To that end, we will build the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>An Amazon VPC, to house our deployments</li>
<li>A series of Amazon subnets for separating deployments by function.</li>
<li>A NAT gateway and some routing logic to let traffic flow.</li>
<li>A bastion host that is SSH-able from the Internet at large.</li>
<li>A BOSH director (surprise!)</li>
<li>A Vault deployment, for storing secure credentials</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the beginning of an entire Genesis Control plane, but we'll save the
rest of the deployments for future tutorials.</p>

<h2>Spinning Up AWS via Terraform</h2>

<p>The first four things on our list are deployed via Terraform.  To make this
easier (and since few truly <em>enjoy</em> writing Terraform configurations), we
are going to use the <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/terraforms">Genesis Terraforms</a> project:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/ops
$ git clone https://github.com/genesis-community/terraforms
$ cf terraforms/lab/aws
</code></pre>

<p>Before Terraform can do its thing, we need to provide it some credentials
for accessing Amazon AWS on our behalf.  Those will go in the <code>aws.tfvars</code>
file:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat &gt;aws.tfvars &lt;&lt;EOF
aws_access_key = "... your Access Key ID ..."
aws_secret_key = "... your Secret Access Key ..."
aws_vpc_name   = "genesis-lab1"
aws_key_name   = "genesis-lab1"
aws_key_file   = "genesis-lab1.pem"
aws_region     = "us-west-2"
EOF
</code></pre>

<p>The only two values you <em>really</em> must change are the <code>aws_access_key</code> and
<code>aws_secret_key</code>.</p>

<p>We also need to generate an EC2 SSH keypair, which will go on the Bastion
host that we are about to deploy.  You may want to refer to these
<a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/terraforms/tree/master/lab/aws#deploying-an-aws-lab">step-by-step instructions</a>.  Make sure the private key exists
in the <code>terraform/lab/aws</code> directory, and is named according to whatever you
put in the <code>aws_key_file</code> variable.</p>

<p>To deploy, we've provided a helpful <code>Makefile</code>, so all you have to do is
type:</p>

<pre><code>$ make
</code></pre>

<p>This spits out a lot of output, mostly just Terraform explaining all the
work its about to perform. At the end, you should see this:</p>

<pre><code>Plan: 14 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value:
</code></pre>

<p>Type <code>yes</code> (Terraform will be happy with nothing else) and it's off to the
races!  And by races, I mean the long and (relatively) slow process of
standing up infrastructure inside of Amazon's data centers.  Go grab a cup
of tea and let Terraform do its thing.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/deploying-bosh-to-aws/tea.jpg" title="image credit Desislava
Dermendzhieva (@desidermz), via Unsplash"></p>

<p>When all is said and done, your termainal should say something like this:</p>

<pre><code>For configuring your proto-BOSH:

  Static IP:       10.4.0.4
  Range (CIDR):    10.4.0.0/20
  Gateway:         10.4.0.1
  DNS:             10.4.0.2

  AWS Region:      us-west-2
  VM Sec. Group:   open-lab
  BOSH Sec. Group: open-lab
  Subnet ID:       subnet-01c354c3403d4149e

To access the bastion host:

  ssh -i genesis-lab1.pem ubuntu@35.164.43.170
</code></pre>

<p><em>(your IP address and Subnet ID will be different.)</em></p>

<h2>Settling in on the Bastion Host</h2>

<p>The bastion host has all the software you need to run Genesis, including
Spruce, Vault, the BOSH and CF CLIs, and, of course, <code>genesis</code> itself.</p>

<p><aside><p><strong>Note:</strong> if you ever forget how the IP address of
your bastion host, and don't want to log into the AWS web console to find
out, you can just run</p>

<pre><code>$ make info</code></pre>

<p>To print out the information you got at the end of the initial
Terraforming.</p></aside></p>

<p>The first time you log into the bastion, you're going to have to do a little
bit of configuration.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo jumpbox system
</code></pre>

<p>The first command sets up global jumpbox-y things.  It installs a slew of
useful utilities like <a href="https://github.com/starkandwayne/safe">safe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/geofffranks/spruce">spruce</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stedolan/jq">jq</a>, and more.
It also installs required commands like <code>bosh</code>, <code>cf</code>, and <code>genesis</code>.</p>

<p>To see what's installed, just run <code>jumpbox</code> with no arguments.</p>

<pre><code>$ jumpbox
&gt;&gt; Checking jumpbox installation
   jumpbox installed - jumpbox v55
   ruby installed - ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
   bosh installed - version 6.1.0-9c1c210c-2019-09-18T17:33:51Z
   cf installed - cf version 6.46.1+4934877ec.2019-08-23
   jq installed - jq-1.6
   spruce installed - spruce - Version 1.22.0
   safe installed - safe v1.3.4
   vault installed - Vault v1.2.3
   genesis installed - [installing genesis runtime]
   sipcalc installed - sipcalc 1.1.6

   git user.name  is 'B. Astion'
   git user.email is 'ubuntu@lab.genesis'

   To bootstrap this installation,  try `jumpbox system`
   To set up your personal environment: `jumpbox user`
   To update this copy of jumpbox, use: `jumpbox sync`
   To create a new local user account:  `jumpbox useradd`
</code></pre>

<h3>The Joys of Terminal Multiplexing</h3>

<p>One final note before we jump into BOSH and Genesis: <code>tmux</code> is an amazing
piece of software.</p>

<p>It's a terminal multiplexer that lets you run lots of terminal sessions,
across a single SSH link.  If you get disconnected, have to reboot your
laptop, or just want to unplug for a long weekend, your tmux session will
still hum along happily on the remote server.</p>

<p>To use tmux, just run <code>tmux</code> from the bastion host (that's important!)</p>

<p>It should look something like this:</p>

<p><img class="full" src="/blog/shared/tmux-screenshot.png"></p>

<p>For the rest of this article, I'm going to assume you're doing everything
from a tmux session.  There's a <a href="https://jameshunt.us/writings/my-tmux-cheat-sheet.html">tmux cheat sheet</a> out there if you
aren't 100% comfortable in tmux.</p>

<h2>Spinning a Temporary Vault</h2>

<p>Genesis leverages <a href="https://vaultproject.io">Hashicorp Vault</a> to generate and securely store
passwords, SSH keys, X.509 certificates and more.  Once we get a BOSH
director up and running (our very next task, actually), we will use it to
deploy a Vault instance.  Until we get that far, however, we need an
<em>initial</em> Vault to jumpstart the process.</p>

<p>This is where <code>safe</code> proves valuable.</p>

<p>Safe (an alternative command-line interface for Vault) provides the means to
run a local Vault instance, on loopback.  It's so easy, we won't have to
worry about configuration, process management, or unsealing / initializing
our nascent Vault.</p>

<p>So, without further ado:</p>

<pre><code>$ safe local --memory --as init
Now targeting (temporary) init at http://127.0.0.1:8201
This Vault is MEMORY-BACKED!
If you want to retain your secrets be sure to safe export.
Ctrl-C to shut down the Vault
</code></pre>

<p>This gives us a <em>memory-backed</em> Vault, named <code>init</code>.  If we kill the process,
we will lose all the secrets.  That might seem like a bad thing, but we only
really have to get through two deployments (about 2 hours wall time), and
a memory-backed initial Vault won't leak credentials as easily.</p>

<p>Once the local Vault is up and running, we can interact with it via <code>safe</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ safe tree
$ safe paths
</code></pre>

<p>etc.</p>

<p><aside><p><strong>Remember</strong> to always run the initial Vault inside
of a tmux session.  You don't want to lose all of your credentials just
because you had to close the lid on your laptop and drive home.</p></aside></p>

<h2>Deploying the Proto-BOSH</h2>

<p>Before we can begin deploying things with BOSH, we need a BOSH director.
This will be our very first Genesis deployment in this environment, and
we'll use the BOSH <code>create-env</code> tooling (under the hood) to get up and
running.</p>

<p><em>(If you don't know what create-env is, or have never stood up a BOSH
director, don't worry; we'll walk through every step of the process.)</em></p>

<p>In Genesis, a <em>proto-BOSH</em> is the initial deployment.  It is used, in turn,
to deploy both the <em>operations tier</em> (Vault, SHIELD, Concourse, etc.), and
also each of the other <em>environment BOSH directors</em>.  Having BOSH deployed
by another BOSH seems a bit weird at first, but it turns out to be a
surprisingly useful optimization.  For one thing, it makes for faster BOSH
director updates.</p>

<p>To deploy something with Genesis, you need a <em>Kit</em>.  Kits roll up most of
the tedious bits of configuring BOSH releases into usable deployments.  They
can be a bit opinionated at times, but we think that makes for better
software and systems.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are going to use the (unsurprisingly-named) <strong>BOSH Genesis
Kit</strong>.  Since this our first deployment of BOSH, we're going to initialize a
new set of deployments, using <code>genesis init</code> (remember to do this from a
<code>tmux</code> session):</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir ~/ops
$ cd ~/ops
$ genesis init -k bosh --vault init
Downloading Genesis kit bosh (latest version)...

Initialized empty Genesis repository in /home/ubuntu/ops/bosh-deployments
using the bosh/1.5.0 kit.
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>genesis init</code> command creates a <em>deployments</em> directory for the type of
thing you are deploying (in our case, BOSH), and then downloads a Genesis
Kit from GitHub.</p>

<p>Next, we need to write an <em>environment</em> file for our new BOSH director.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd bosh-deployments
$ genesis new jhunt-aws
</code></pre>

<p>Genesis will then ask a whole bunch of (pertinent) questions about your
configuration, infrastructure / cloud provider, and your preferences.
First up, Genesis needs to know if you want a <em>proto-BOSH</em> or a <em>regular
BOSH</em>.  We don't yet have a BOSH director, so we need to deploy a
proto-BOSH.  Say "y" here.</p>

<pre><code>Is this a proto-BOSH director?
[y|n] &gt; y
</code></pre>

<p>After that, Genesis asks a series of questions about the networking for this
director.  These answers come from our understanding of the Terraform
configuration we deployed.  You can use these values verbatim.</p>

<pre><code>What static IP do you want to deploy this BOSH director on?
&gt; 10.4.0.4

What network should this BOSH director exist in (in CIDR notation)?
&gt; 10.4.0.0/20

What default gateway (IP address) should this BOSH director use?
&gt; 10.4.0.1

What DNS servers should BOSH use? (leave value empty to end)
1st value &gt; 10.4.0.2
2nd value &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To properly configure the BOSH director, Genesis needs to know where we are
deploying (what cloud provider / IaaS).  This is AWS, so answer "2".</p>

<pre><code>What IaaS will this BOSH director orchestrate?
1) VMWare vSphere
2) Amazon Web Services
3) Microsoft Azure
4) Google Cloud Platform
5) OpenStack
6) BOSH Warden

Select choice &gt; 2
</code></pre>

<p>Now that Genesis knows we're in Amazon, it can ask more pointed questions
about how we expect the BOSH director to access AWS on our behalf.</p>

<pre><code>What AWS region would you like to deploy to?
&gt; us-west-2

What is your AWS Access Key?
&gt; ... type your key here ...

What is your AWS Secret Key?
secret_key [hidden]:
secret_key [confirm]:
</code></pre>

<p>Next up, you will be asked for security groups, and the subnet ID to deploy
the director to.</p>

<pre><code>What security groups should the all deployed VMs be placed in? (leave value
empty to end)
1st value &gt; open-lab
2nd value &gt;

What is the ID of the AWS subnet you want to deploy to?
&gt; subnet-01c354c3403d4149e

What security groups should the BOSH Director VM be in? (leave value empty
to end)
1st value &gt; open-lab
2nd value &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Hint: you can find the AWS Subnet ID in the output of <code>make info</code>.</p>

<p><em>(The open-lab security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic, on
all ports, to and from all hosts, all protocols.  It won't pass muster on a
production system, but it sure is handy in lab environments.)</em></p>

<p>That concludes the question &amp; answer session.</p>

<p>Finally, you'll be asked if you want to edit the environment file.  You can
safely say "no" here; we won't be customizing this proto-BOSH.</p>

<p>Now it is Genesis' turn to do some thinking and processing.  You should see
something that looks like this (depending on what you named your
environment):</p>

<pre><code> - auto-generating credentials (in secret/jhunt/aws/bosh)...
 - auto-generating certificates (in secret/jhunt/aws/bosh)...

New environment jhunt-aws provisioned!

To deploy, run this:

  genesis deploy 'jhunt-aws'
</code></pre>

<p>Genesis just generated all of the random passwords and required X.509
certificates that a functioning BOSH director needs.  Isn't that neat?
There is one thing to be done manually in the AWS console, and the Genesis
<code>new</code> wizard helpfully explains the what, why, and how.</p>

<p>Before we go off and <code>genesis deploy</code> this BOSH director, scroll back
through the output in your terminal until you find this:</p>

<pre><code>Before deploying, please be sure to import the keypair
generated for you from Vault into AWS console.

First run the following command to get the public key:

    safe get secret/jhunt/aws/bosh/aws/ssh:public

Then go to EC2 &gt; Key Pairs &gt; Import Key Pair and:

  1. Type 'vcap@jhunt-aws' in the 'Key pair name' input box
  2. Paste the safe command output into the 'Public key contents' input box
  3. Click 'Import' button

Now you can SSH into VMs deployed by this director
using the generated key.
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the keys for the SSH EC2 keypair have been generated in the Vault,
it's time time import them into AWS itself.</p>

<p>So go do that.</p>

<p>Finally, we can run that <code>genesis deploy</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>$ genesis deploy jhunt-aws
</code></pre>

<p>When that finishes, follow the on-screen instructions and log into the BOSH
director:</p>

<pre><code>$ genesis do jhunt-aws -- login
Running login addon for jhunt-aws
Logging you in as user 'admin'...
Using environment 'https://10.4.0.4:25555'

Email (): admin
Password ():

Successfully authenticated with UAA

Succeeded
</code></pre>

<h2>Moving Into Our New BOSH Director</h2>

<p>The BOSH director is deployed, but before we can use it to deploy something,
we need to do two things.</p>

<ol>
<li>Upload a Xenial Stemcell</li>
<li>Install a valid Cloud Config</li>
</ol>

<h3>Uploading Stemcells</h3>

<p>The BOSH Genesis Kit sports this wonderful addon called <em>upload-stemcells</em>
that provides a menu driven interface for selecting and uploading stemcells
(the stuff deployment VMs are made of).  It properly limits which stemcell
variants are considered, based on the IaaS you configured the director for.</p>

<p>Since we're going to need a stemcell, let's take it for a spin!</p>

<pre><code>$ genesis do jhunt-aws -- upload-stemcells
</code></pre>

<p>This will show you the major and minor versions of the Xenial stemcell
series (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) for AWS, and let you pick which you want to
upload.  The upload is handed off to the BOSH director, and when you get
back to a prompt you should be good to go.</p>

<p>I tested with Xenial 456.x (latest minor revision).</p>

<h3>Configuring Clouds</h3>

<p>BOSH Cloud Config is one of the more arcane and esoteric parts of BOSH.
To help make this easier, the <strong>Genesis Terraforms</strong> repository can build a
rudimentary, baseline cloud config, if you ask it to.</p>

<p>From wherever you ran the Terraforming process, run:</p>

<pre><code>$ make cc
</code></pre>

<p>That will print out a cloud config YAML document that you can transfer to
the bastion host, and use that to <code>bosh update-cloud-config</code>.</p>

<p>This cloud config defines a <code>default</code> network, some generic VM types (small,
medium, large), a default disk type, and a single availability zone (z1).
It should suffice to get us through the next deployment, and since this is a
lab, you're probably going to modify it eventually anyway!</p>

<h2>Deploying a Real Vault</h2>

<p>Now that we have a BOSH director, a stemcell, and a cloud config, we can
deploy a real Vault to replace the ephemeral <code>safe local</code> Vault we've been
using up to now.  We'll repeat the same dance of <code>genesis init</code> / <code>genesis
new</code>, only this time, for the <strong>Vault Genesis Kit</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/ops
$ genesis init -k vault
$ cd vault-deployments
$ genesis new jhunt-aws
</code></pre>

<p>The Vault kit is mercifully less chatty than the BOSH Director kit, so there
isn't much in the way of questions to answer during <code>genesis new</code>.  We will
be asked if this is the <em>Genesis Vault</em>.  It is, so answer "y" to that one.</p>

<p>If you try to deploy the Vault now (go ahead, I'll wait) it will fail,
because the Vault Kit expects to deploy a highly-available cluster across
three different availability zones.  Our lab only has one AZ, so it doesn't
work.</p>

<p>Not a big deal, all we have to do is open up the <code>jhunt-aws.yml</code> file (in
<code>vault-deployments/</code>) in our favorite editor, and add this to the <code>params:</code>
stanza:</p>

<pre><code>params:
  availability_zones: [z1]
  stemcell_os: ubuntu-xenial
</code></pre>

<p>Changing <code>stemcell_os</code> is also necessary, because (at least as of 1.2.1) the
Vault Kit expects to deploy to the latest Ubuntu Trusty (14.04 LTS), but we
only uploaded Xenial stemcells.</p>

<p>Now we can deploy.</p>

<pre><code>$ genesis deploy jhunt-aws
</code></pre>

<p>After the deployment succeeds, we need to initialize the Vault:</p>

<pre><code>$ genesis do jhunt-aws -- init
</code></pre>

<p>This sets up a safe target in your local configuration, named <code>jhunt-aws</code>
(after the environment).  We are now able to transfer all of our
credentials from the ephemeral <code>init</code> Vault to their forever home.</p>

<pre><code>$ safe -T init export | safe -T jhunt-aws import
</code></pre>

<p>It is now safe to kill the <code>safe local</code> process.</p>

<p>Congratulations! </p>

<h2>Where To From Here?</h2>

<p>Hopefully you've had fun setting up this little AWS lab.  The BOSH director
we deployed has Credhub installed, so you're able to deploy whatever you
want to it, with or without the power of Genesis.</p>

      <h1>GMP-CF-0002 - Optionally Removing Consul in 1.3</h1>
      
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <div>
      
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><em>Note: previously, this GMP had stated that 1.4.0 of the Cloud Foundry Genesis
Kit would be when the Consul components were officially removed.  1.4.0 was
released on May 2nd, 2019, without this removal.  This GMP has been updated
to instead target the 1.5.0 release.</em></p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>With BOSH DNS a mature product and an integral component in many BOSH
deployments, we have begun replacing Consul service discovery with
BOSH DNS. The Cloud Foundry Genesis Kit v1.3 is the first step in this
two-step phase. v1.3 colocates BOSH DNS and disables Consul DNS, but
does not remove Consul entirely. The result is a seamless upgrade from
v1.2.X while also leveraging BOSH DNS for service discovery.</p>

<p>It is our plan to fully remove Consul from the Cloud Foundry Genesis
Kit in v1.5, which will include the deletion of all <code>consul_etcd</code>
virtual machines. This is the second step of the two-step phase, which
enables a zero-downtime upgrade path from Consul DNS to BOSH DNS.</p>

<p>However, if an operator wishes to remove all Consul related services
from their Cloud Foundry deployment without waiting for v1.5, they may
do so with a temporary feature flag implemented just for v1.3 called
<code>migrate-1.3-without-consul</code>. This GMP will explain the steps
necessary to use this feature.</p>

<h1>Impact</h1>

<p>The impact of this feature is minimal to the runtime and stability of
your Cloud Foundry deployment. The decision to either apply or not
apply this feature to your deployments will not impact future
upgradability of this environment. No extra steps are necessary to
maintain your Cloud Foundry environment after this GMP is completed.</p>

<p>There is no downtime incurred by applying this feature.</p>

<h1>The Process</h1>

<h2>Determining Eligibility</h2>

<p>Operators who wish to remove all Consul services from their Cloud
Foundry deployment are only able to do so if their Genesis Cloud
Foundry is version v1.3. To determine the version of the deployed
Cloud Foundry environment, run the following command within your
<code>cf-deployments</code> folder:</p>

<pre><code>genesis info [environment name]
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>[environment name]</code> is the name of the Cloud Foundry
environment you wish to check.</p>

<p>The result will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>CF Deployment for Environment 'genesis-lab'

  Last deployed about 30 minutes ago (08:32PM on Dec 19, 2018 UTC)
            by David
        to BOSH genesis-lab
  based on kit cf/1.3
          using Genesis v2.6.12
  with manifest .genesis/manifests/buffalo-lab.yml (redacted)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>based on kit</code> line must read <code>cf/1.3</code>. If it does not, please
upgrade your Cloud Foundry installation with the v1.3 Cloud Foundry
Genesis Kit before starting.</p>

<p>If your <code>based on kit</code> line reads <code>cf/1.3</code>, and you wish to remove
Consul entirely, please continue reading this guide.</p>

<h2>Removing Consul</h2>

<p>After ensuring the environment you wish to remove Consul from is on
v1.3, edit your Genesis Environment Manifest and append
<code>migrate-1.3-without-consul</code> to the feature list array. The end result
will be something similar to:</p>

<pre><code>---
kit:
  name:   cf
  version: 1.3
  features:
  - local-blobstore
  - local-ha-db
  - migrate-1.3-without-consul
params:
  env:   genesis-lab
  [...]
</code></pre>

<p>Once the feature has been added to your Genesis Environment Manifest,
apply the changes with a <code>genesis deploy</code>:</p>

<pre><code>genesis deploy [environment name]
</code></pre>

<p>This will remove any <code>consul_agents</code> colocated on VMs, as well as
removing all <code>consul_etcd</code> VMs currently deployed. There will be no
downtime during this deployment.</p>

<h2>Deployments With Multiple Cell Instance Groups</h2>

<p>If your deployment has multiple instance groups for cells (possibly for
isolation segments), then you will need to add additional DNS aliases,
or else the Auctioneer will not be able to locate Rep instances on the
additional instance groups. As a result, applications will not be deployed
to the additional cell instance groups.</p>

<p>To map the correct DNS aliases to the additional cell instance groups, add
the following to your environment file.</p>

<pre><code>addons:
- name: bosh-dns-aliases
  jobs:
  - name: bosh-dns-aliases
    release: bosh-dns-aliases
    properties:
      aliases:
      - domain: '_.cell.service.cf.internal'
        targets:
        - (( append ))
        - query: '_'
          instance_group: extra-cell-instance-group-1-name
          deployment: (( grab name ))
          network: (( grab params.cf_runtime_network ))
          domain: bosh
        - query: '_'
          instance_group: extra-cell-instance-group-2-name
          deployment: (( grab name ))
          network: (( grab params.cf_runtime_network ))
          domain: bosh
</code></pre>

<p>Add a block under the targets array for each additional instance
group that you have. Change the <code>instance_group</code> value to the name
of each additional cell instance group. To be clear, you do not
need to add one for the instance group named cell.</p>

<h2>Verification &amp; Closing Notes (Final step)</h2>

<p>Once the deployment is complete, you can verify that Consul is no
longer used in your environment by running:</p>

<pre><code>bosh -e [environment name] -d [deployment name] vms
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>[environment name]</code> is the name of your BOSH director alias,
and <code>[deployment name]</code> is the name of your Cloud Foundry environment.</p>

<p>If you do not see any <code>consul_etcd</code> VMs listed, the feature was
successfully applied. </p>

<p>It is necessary to keep the <code>migrate-1.3-without-consul</code> feature until
the v1.5 update is released. Genesis Cloud Foundry Kit v1.5 will
remind you to remove the feature, as it will no longer be needed.</p>

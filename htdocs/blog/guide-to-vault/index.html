      <p>Vault is an open-source secrets management software. We will talk a bit
about the problem that secrets present, vault as a solution to that problem,
and using genesis and safe to implement vault in a deployment. I will also
assume that you used Genesis to deploy your primary vault as done in any of
the Deploying Bosh using Genesis posts.</p>

<h2>The Problem with Secrets</h2>

<p>Even a simple software deployment is riddled with secrets. SSH, API, and RSA
keys, certificates, usernames, passwords - the list goes on. So that begs
the question, where do we store all of that?</p>

<p>We could hard code them. Make the repo private, only those in your org can
see it. Great, no problem. Until someone accidentally makes the wrong repo
public, and your whole deployment is exposed,</p>

<p>Then how about using environment variables? Keep them all local, awesome.
Well, they are in your environment and you need to share them with the team.
Oh, we'll just put them in a private repo just for the env vars! Wait, but
we already ruled that out.</p>

<p>Then lets use a database. That'll do it. As long as you trust your database
administrator, the database host against online attacks, and that no one can
get to the physical disks for an offline attack... Okay, lets encrypt the
data base, but then, what do we do with the encryption key? We could hard
code it! ...Or make it an environment variable! ...Or Store it in the
database next to what it is encrypting?</p>

<p>Vault can help with the problem of storing the secrets for the deployment.
It isn't perfect, there is still the case of the unseal keys, but there are
solutions in the Vault Genesis kit to help with that as well.</p>

<h2>Basics of Sealing and Unsealing</h2>

<p>Vault encrypts all of its contents and the key is only ever held in memory.
This means that the vault will automatically "reseal" itself on reboot. What
if you want to manually seal the vault in a "break glass in case of
emergency" type of situation. The vault we deployed is by default in <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/ha.html">High
Availability Mode (HA)</a>.
In our case, there are three instances of the same vault each on their own
VM. If one is a primary node and if that goes down, there are two redundant
nodes ready to take over. That means that each vault node needs to be sealed
starting with the active node, then recursively finding the new active node
one by one until all are sealed Not too bad in our deployment of 3 nodes. I
have seen as many as 5 or 7 redundant nodes. Safe makes sealing the entire
vault easy.</p>

<pre><code>$ safe seal
sealed https://10.0.0.5:443...
sealed https://10.0.0.4:443...
sealed https://10.0.0.6:443...
</code></pre>

<p>So we can seal a vault manually with safe and we know that the vault will be
sealed on reboot. What about unsealing?</p>

<p>When the vault is initialized with the Vault Genesis kit, you (hopefully)
noticed Genesis write this to the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>Unseal Key #1: ~~~ Key 1 ~~~
Unseal Key #2: ~~~ Key 2 ~~~
Unseal Key #3: ~~~ Key 3 ~~~
Unseal Key #4: ~~~ Key 4 ~~~
Unseal Key #5: ~~~ Key 5 ~~~
Initial Root Token: ~~~ Token ~~~

Vault initialized with 5 keys and a key threshold of 3. Please
securely distribute the above keys. When the Vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must provide at least 3 of these keys
to unseal it again.

Vault does not store the master key. Without at least 3 keys,
your Vault will remain permanently sealed.
</code></pre>

<p>These keys and token are important. The token is used with <code>safe auth</code> to
authenticate with the vault. This is saved in your <code>.saferc</code>, but would be
needed if that file is lost or you were allowing another machine access to
the vault.</p>

<p>As the output above states, three keys must be provided to build the master
key. This means you can store all those keys yourself, or divide them up -
give one to yourself, John, Jane, Mary, and Mark.</p>

<p>As long as you have the keys, unsealing with safe is straight forward.</p>

<pre><code>$ safe status
https://10.0.0.5:443 is sealed
https://10.0.0.6:443 is sealed
https://10.0.0.4:443 is sealed

$ safe unseal
You need 3 key(s) to unseal the vaults.

Key #1:
Key #2:
Key #3:
unsealing https://10.0.0.5:443...
unsealing https://10.0.0.6:443...
unsealing https://10.0.0.4:443...

$ safe status
https://10.0.0.4:443 is unsealed
https://10.0.0.5:443 is unsealed
https://10.0.0.6:443 is unsealed
</code></pre>

<h2>Primary vs Secondary Vault</h2>

<p>When you deploy a vault using the Vault Genesis kit, the first thing it asks is:</p>

<pre><code>Is this your Genesis Vault (for storing deployment credentials)?
[y|n] &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When you select <code>y</code> here, Genesis makes that deployment the primary vault
for the entire deployment. This will store the creds required to deploy any
apps - things like creds to access vms to spin up applications, not creds
for individual applications or users. For example, say the dev team wants to
store creds for their app in a vault. Naturally, you don't want to give
every engineer on the dev team access to your primary vault. You would
command <code>genesis new vault-dev</code>, select <code>n</code> when prompted, deploy with
<code>genesis deploy vault-dev</code> then that team performs <code>genesis do vault-dev --
init</code>. It is then up to them to actually manage the vault and its contents.
But you would still manage the deployment.</p>

<h2>Vault in a Pipeline</h2>

<p>Using Vault in a pipeline can be tough. For example, new stemcells are
released, the pipeline goes into action and starts with primary vault. The
vault deployment updates just fine. The pipeline moves to the next
deployment, asks vault for the creds - vault was just sealed at reboot.</p>

<p>Upon initializing the primary vault with the vault Genesis kit, the unseal
keys are stored inside the newly initialized vault. That may seem like a
strange place to store the keys, like locking your keys inside your car.
This allows Genesis to grab the unseal keys prior to rebooting the vault
deployment. Genesis then unseals the vault at reboot and the pipeline can
continue running.</p>

<h2>Working with Multiple Vaults</h2>

<p>If you have multiple deployments, you may be dealing with multiple vaults.
Safe has a convenient setup for that as well.</p>

<pre><code>$ safe targets
Known Vault targets - current target indicated with a (*):
(*) buffalo-lab   (noverify) https://10.128.4.4
    genesis-ci    (noverify) https://10.128.8.12
    jumpbox       (insecure) http://10.128.80.192:8200
</code></pre>

<p>To change targets:</p>

<pre><code>$ safe target genesis-ci
Now targeting genesis-ci at https://10.128.8.12 (skipping TLS certificate verification)

$ safe targets
Known Vault targets - current target indicated with a (*):
    buffalo-lab   (noverify) https://10.128.4.4
(*) genesis-ci    (noverify) https://10.128.8.12
    jumpbox       (insecure) http://10.128.80.192:8200
</code></pre>

<p>To add a new target:</p>

<pre><code>$ safe target my-vault https://vault.ip
Now targeting my-vault at https://vault.ip

$ safe targets
Known Vault targets - current target indicated with a (*):
    buffalo-lab   (noverify) https://10.128.4.4
    genesis-ci    (noverify) https://10.128.8.12
    jumpbox       (insecure) http://10.128.80.192:8200
(*) my-vault                 https://vault.ip
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>-k</code> to skip TLS:</p>

<pre><code>$ safe -k target  my-vault-k https://vault.ip
Now targeting my-vault-k at https://vault.ip

$ safe targets
Known Vault targets - current target indicated with a (*):
    buffalo-lab   (noverify) https://10.128.4.4
    genesis-ci    (noverify) https://10.128.8.12
    jumpbox       (insecure) http://10.128.80.192:8200
    my-vault                 https://vault.ip
(*) my-vault-k    (noverify) https://vault.ip
</code></pre>
